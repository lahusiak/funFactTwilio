# funFactTwilio
Swift Application that generates random facts and sends them as a text messages using twilio(test).

I wanted to continue expanding my knowledge of connecting with APIs and building Swift applications. 
On page load, this app displays a random fact using: http://numbersapi.com/#42.
The user can click a button until they find a fact they want to send. 
Then enter the phone number they want it to go to.
And send fact as a text. 

Right now, the app is using a twilio test account, so it will not acutally send the message,
but it does provide a confirmation response in the console to say it was successful.
